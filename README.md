# Note on Project Functionality

I want to note that the project may not run perfectly at this stage, and the JAR file may encounter issues when opening. As I'm still learning to effectively showcase projects on GitHub, there may be limitations in how the project is presented or accessed.

I'm actively working on improving my skills on these aspects. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly welcome and appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
